This code follows the bumperbot udemy course and features some of my own code for personal development.
Things to note:
When creating a gazebo plugin with ros2, ensure (if using VSCode) that C++17 is selected, otherwise a series of compiler errors will be present in the VSCode window. Despite these errors, the code does compile and function correctly. C++17 will also ensure autocomplete works correctly which helps with learning Gazebo plugin development.
